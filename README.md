# Census_Data_EDA_LogisticRegression
This project evaluates the predictive performance of a machine learning model on the UCI Census Income dataset, which categorizes individuals into income brackets based on demographic and employment data. We aim to predict whether an individualâ€™s income will be greater than $50K annually.
